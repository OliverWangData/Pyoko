# Pyoko

A performance-focused Survivors-like game prototype built in Godot 4.x using C#, featuring:
- Custom physics engine supporting 20,000+ moving entities
- Tilemap-based procedural placement of assets, enabling deterministic but varied environment details
- CSV-driven database system for content/data management
- Modular UI with early menu and HUD implementation
- Basic placeholder art to support gameplay prototyping

# Goals
- Stress-test Godot's performance ceiling with large-scale gameplay
- Build clean C# systems that can scale into full game architecture
- Rapidly iterate core mechanics for Survivors-inspired gameplay
